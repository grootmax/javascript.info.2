How to copy by value a composite datatype (array + objects)?
There are three ways to copy by value for composite data types.
Using the Spread operator (…) operator.
Using the Object.assign() method.
Using the JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods
The Spread Operator
The spread operator (…) does a shallow copy of the variable data. It copies the values present that is the non primitive data type.
The Object.assign()
The Object.assign() method copies all properties from one source object to a target object. It returns the target object. This does the shallow copy of the original object.
The JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify()
The JSON object is available in all the browsers, this has two methods for JSON data i.e the parse and the stringify. Parse takes a JSON string and transforms it into JS Object and Stringify takes JS Object and transforms into a JSON Object.
